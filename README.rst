revue: getting Tumbleweed on it.
================================

This is a series of notes and articles about getting OpenSuSE [#opensuse]_ Tumbleweed [#tumbleweed]_ to run on a headless [#headless]_ (i.e. text-only, no GUI) server.

The first machine I installed OpenSuSE Tumbleweed on is ``revue`` [#revue]_. It is a bit of a gimmic, as I already had machines called ``snip`` and ``snap``. Dutch people will know why.

``snip`` and ``snap`` run regular OpenSuSE releases. ``revue`` is my first machine running a `rolling<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_release>`_ release.

Over time, there will be some documents indicating installtion progress and problem solving.

.. [#opensuse] I keep using the old `SuSE<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUSE>`_ writing, I'm an old fart.

.. [#tumbleweed] `Tumbleweed<https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed>`_ is the rolling release of OpenSuSE.

.. [#revue] See `Snip en Snap revue<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snip_en_Snap>`_.

.. [#headless] `Headless<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_software>`_ as in no GUI, not as in `Embedded System<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system>`_. So there is a text `console<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_console>`_, and remote `ssh<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell>`_.
